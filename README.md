# Distributed-Interference-Alignment-for-K--user-Interference-Channels-via-Deep-Learning

This code has the source code for the paper with the same name.
It has the following main parts.
1) A code base that trains the NN Models and saves them
2) Generates the test results with respect to MSE and saves them
3) Generates the test results with respect to Mutual Information and saves them
4) Generates TX Out data and saves them
5) Plots the MSE, MI and the constellation figures.

The codes are basically of the following algorithms
1) MaxSINR Algorithm
2) TIMTIN Algorithm
3) Pretrained MaxSINR
4) Pretrained TIMTIN
5) AE End to End without pretraining
